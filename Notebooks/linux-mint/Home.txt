Find out if I can setup protonvpn to allow Grok to bypass the vpn will ensuring I continue to have full coverage for system apps like qBittorrent
	Need to ensure this process is added to my install package
	May need to add Openvpn selection to Polybar

Have Grok send a report about providing too much information for most people all the time. This uses up excess resources for every chat. 

Need to address volume not working in Netflix

GPG key issue for the Warp repository

Polybar update module not displaying updates

Add [[~/brave/]] directory to the dotfile backup

Improve the option for launching vpn so I can add to polybar
