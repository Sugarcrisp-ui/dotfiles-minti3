Have Grok send a report about providing too much information for most people all the time. This uses up excess resources for every chat. 

~~Add [[~/.mozilla/]] to dotfiles~~

~~Modify dotfiles-backup.sh to cp files with ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM) timestamp. Also want to keep 3 copies~~ 

adjust scripts with timestamp to use 'Apr-27-22:59' format

Put a copy of .fonts on external drive and remove from [[~/dotfiles/]] and from the backup script
	Need to adjust the install script also
